//! Hidden-line projection and section views — what OpenCascade's `HLRBRep` gives build123d's
//! `project_to_viewport`, and draftwright's section A–A without its boolean: a part's edges and
//! silhouettes seen along a direction, each split into its visible and hidden stretches.
//!
//! The curves drawn are the solids' B-rep edges (less seams and the joins between pieces of one
//! surface, which OpenCascade leaves out) — sharp, or smooth where the faces meet tangentially —
//! and each curved face's silhouette, the contour where its normal is perpendicular to the view.
//! Seen in the view, a curve can only pass behind or come out from behind something where its
//! projection crosses another curve's or ends on one, so each curve is cut at every such point
//! and each piece's visibility decided once, exactly, by a ray from its middle towards the
//! viewer (a drawing with a piece no ray can decide is refused).
//!
//! A section keeps the curves on one side of a plane and adds the plane's own contours across
//! the faces; a ray then runs only to the plane, where it is stopped by the cut face if it
//! arrives inside the material.
