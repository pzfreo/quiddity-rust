//! The removal plan: which instances of a [`Document`] go when a set of instances (the *seeds*,
//! e.g. the instances the PMI reader consumed for a part) is removed, which kept instances are
//! rewritten, and — when something that stays would be left referencing a removed instance and
//! the policy does not allow removing it — a refusal naming every such instance. It is a
//! document-level operation, independent of the PMI model (design, Architecture item 6).
//!
//! **The removed set R** is the least fixpoint of:
//!
//! 1. every seed is in R;
//! 2. an instance `t` that an instance of R references is in R when (a) every instance that
//!    references `t` is in R or *does not hold* `t` (below), and (b) `t` is not *shared
//!    infrastructure*.
//!
//! *Shared infrastructure* is never removed by 2, even when only removed instances referenced
//! it (it is then kept, unreferenced, and listed in [`RemovalReport::left_unreferenced`]):
//!
//! - an instance with a part that is a [`INFRASTRUCTURE`] type: units (`named_unit`,
//!   `derived_unit`, `derived_unit_element`, `dimensional_exponents`), contexts
//!   (`representation_context`, `application_context`, `application_context_element`,
//!   `application_protocol_definition`) and product structure (`product`,
//!   `product_definition_formation`, `product_definition`, `product_definition_shape`,
//!   `product_definition_relationship`, `product_category`);
//! - the B-rep: every `topological_representation_item`, every representation a
//!   `property_definition_representation` uses for a `product_definition_shape` (the parts'
//!   shape representations), and every instance of family [`Family::Other`] reachable from
//!   those by forward references through instances of family Other (their items, geometry,
//!   topology, placements and contexts).
//!
//! Nor does rule 2 remove a presentation `representation` (a draughting model, a view): the
//! associations and items in it only use it; it is rewritten or the plan refused (below).
//!
//! A seed that is shared infrastructure is refused.
//!
//! **Blockers.** Every kept instance that references an instance of R is a blocker, classified
//! by [`instance_family`]:
//!
//! - [`Family::Presentation`] and [`Family::ValidationProperty`]: with
//!   [`PresentationPolicy::Refuse`] the plan is refused, naming each blocker. With
//!   [`PresentationPolicy::RemovePresentation`]:
//!   - a *list container* ([`LIST_CONTAINERS`]: a presentation `representation` —
//!     `draughting_model`, presentation views, sets of styled or mapped items — by its
//!     `items`) whose references to R are all direct members of that list is rewritten without
//!     them; a rewrite that would empty an aggregate whose lower bound is at least 1 is
//!     refused, naming the instance and the attribute (a model or view is an entity in its own
//!     right, with a name, a context and views of it: emptying it is the caller's decision);
//!   - a *group* ([`GROUPS`]: `annotation_plane` by `elements`, `draughting_callout` by
//!     `contents`, `invisibility` by `invisible_items`, `presentation_layer_assignment` by
//!     `assigned_items`: instances that only state something about their members) whose
//!     references to R are all direct members of its list is rewritten without them, or joins
//!     R when they were all its members (it then states nothing);
//!   - any other blocker joins R, and with it, by rule 2, what it exclusively owns (a
//!     callout's annotation occurrences, their geometry, styles and tessellations);
//!
//!   and the blockers of the grown R are classified again, until none is new. Under
//!   `RemovePresentation` two refinements of rule 2 apply: a list container or group does not
//!   hold the direct members of its list (they may go; it is rewritten), and the item a removed
//!   `draughting_model_item_association` presents (its `identified_item`, and the placeholder
//!   or image of its subtypes) is not held by presentation or validation-property instances
//!   other than draughting model item associations: those depend on the presented item and
//!   become blockers in turn (a callout's relationships, its annotation plane, the
//!   validation properties of it). An association that stays still holds what it presents.
//! - anything else ([`Family::SemanticPmi`] that is not removed, [`Family::Other`]): the plan
//!   is refused, naming it, whatever the policy.
//!
//! An instance the file's ANCHOR section names is refused too. The plan is deterministic: R is
//! a least fixpoint, independent of visiting order, and every list is in id order.
