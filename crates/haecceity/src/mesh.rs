//! Faces as triangle meshes — what OpenCascade's `BRepMesh_IncrementalMesh` gives the Python
//! implementations (specify-core's mesh command and 3-D face picker): each face triangulated to
//! a chordal and an angular deflection, its vertices on the exact surface, its triangles wound
//! by the face's outward normal.
//!
//! 1. Boundary. Each edge is discretised once, for every face that uses it: its samples thinned
//!    so a chord stands for the samples it skips in space and, on each face's surface, its
//!    straight line in that face's parameters stands for them too, and the normals along it
//!    turn by no more than the angular deflection; then divided where a face's surface needs a
//!    closer spacing along it than the chord gives. Samples a face routes along a pole's line,
//!    or that stray within the deflection past a parameter line its boundary follows (an edge
//!    meeting a torus's top circle tangentially, see `straying`), are kept by neither face, and
//!    an edge running through a pole takes the pole as a point.
//!    Both faces of an edge take the same points ([`BoundaryPoint`]), at the edge's own
//!    positions in space, so a closed shell's mesh is watertight.
//! 2. Polygons. A face's boundary loops ([`Part::uv_loops`]: unwrapped across periodic
//!    parameters, with poles and apexes routed along their parameter lines) carry the edges'
//!    points into its parameter space, unwrapped again across the seam of a closed freeform
//!    surface (which the reader marks non-periodic). A periodic face with no seam edge has two
//!    loops that each run once round (a seamless band, a cone up to its apex, a whole sphere
//!    between its poles): it is cut along a straight parameter line between a point of each, one
//!    that misses every hole, and both sides of the cut are the same points. Holes are moved by
//!    whole periods into the region they belong to. A side along a parameter line whose image
//!    strays from its chord (haecceity's closing of a loop along a pole) is sampled; any other
//!    side that strays is a jump across the surface and the face is refused.
//! 3. A constrained Delaunay triangulation (spade) of the polygons runs in parameter
//!    coordinates scaled to the spacing the surface needs in each direction (its normal's
//!    turning and its bending), so triangles lie along a cylinder's rulings rather than across
//!    them. It is refined by inserting edge midpoints until the surface strays from no triangle
//!    by more than the chordal deflection, the normals at an edge's ends differ by at most the
//!    angular deflection, and no triangle leans from the surface by more than it. Boundary sides
//!    are never split. A plane is meshed from its boundary alone.
//! 4. The triangles inside the polygons (by crossing parity, flooding the triangulation) are
//!    mapped onto the exact surface and wound so their normal is the face's outward one:
//!    counter-clockwise in (u, v) is along the surface's natural normal `Su × Sv`, which a
//!    reversed face points against. Points that are one point in space (a pole's parameter
//!    line, the two sides of a cut) are one vertex. A sliver folded against the surface is left
//!    out and counted ([`FaceMesh::folded_dropped`]); a triangle too thin to see is kept.
//!
//! Honest failure: a face whose surface did not resolve, whose loops do not close or collapse,
//! whose boundary crosses itself in parameter space even unthinned, whose boundary jumps across
//! the surface, or whose periodic loops cannot be cut is refused with the reason
//! ([`MeshRefusal`]). No patch is guessed, and no face is dropped silently.
//!
//! The method is specify-core-rust's stand-in (its `triangulate.rs`, upstream need U4), with
//! the boundary discretised per edge instead of per face.
