//! Areas and volumes (`BRepGProp`): surface integrals over each face's trimmed parameter
//! domain, reduced by Green's theorem to integrals along the exact edge curves (the region
//! their foot points on the surface bound, which is where OpenCascade's own answer lands once
//! a face's pcurves are projected from those curves) and evaluated by Gauss quadrature to near
//! machine precision (the body signatures families publish round them to twelve significant
//! figures). `tests/face_areas.rs` checks every corpus face against OpenCascade.
//!
//! ∬_D f du dv = −∮ H du with H(u, v) = ∫ f(u, s) ds from a fixed v, or ∮ G dv with
//! G(u, v) = ∫ f(s, v) ds from a fixed u. The first ignores boundary pieces of constant u
//! (seams, which files may omit) and serves faces whose loops run round u; the second ignores
//! pieces of constant v (a sphere's poles, a cone's apex) and serves every other face. Where a
//! loop runs round u and ends at a singular line, H starts from that line, and G starts from a
//! B-spline side that collapses to a point, so the line itself contributes nothing and the
//! parameter left undetermined there does not matter. Along each edge the integral is
//! adaptive (Gauss–Kronrod), split where the foot point turns a corner onto or off the
//! surface's boundary or crosses a knot line. Each loop's direction is read from the geometry
//! (which side of it the face lies on), not from the file's orientation flags.
