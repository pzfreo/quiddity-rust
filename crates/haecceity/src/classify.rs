//! Point-in-solid classification by ray parity — the stand-in for
//! `BRepClass3d_SolidClassifier`.
//!
//! A ray is cast from the point; each crossing of a face (the untrimmed surface hit, kept when
//! the hit lies inside the face's trimming loops) flips inside/outside. A ray that passes too
//! close to an edge or grazes a surface is discarded and another direction tried, so the answer
//! never rests on a knife-edge hit.
