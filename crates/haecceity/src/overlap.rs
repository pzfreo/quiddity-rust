//! The common area of two coplanar planar faces (`BRepAlgoAPI_Common` of the two faces and the
//! surface area of the result), without a face boolean: both faces' boundary loops, placed and
//! projected into the first face's plane, intersected as polygons with holes (the `i_overlay`
//! crate, even-odd fill), and the area of the result. specify-core's contacts (the area two
//! facing flat faces of different parts share) read it.
//!
//! Straight edges are exact. Circular arcs are sampled afresh from their exact curves, finely
//! enough that a chord strays at most [`ARC_SAGITTA`] of the radius from its arc, so faces bounded
//! by lines and circles give the exact area to 1e-8 of a circle's. Other curves use the edge's
//! samples (within the sampling's chord tolerance, 2e-4 mm, of the curve), so their area can
//! differ from the exact one in the fourth decimal. A loop that does not close, or runs along an
//! edge whose curve did not resolve, is refused rather than closed by a guess.
