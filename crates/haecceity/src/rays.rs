//! Rays against a solid's faces — the stand-in for `IntCurvesFace_ShapeIntersector`: every
//! point where a ray meets a face within its trimming loops, with the face it meets. A hit on a
//! face's boundary counts as on the face (OpenCascade reports `ON` points too), so a ray through
//! an edge meets both faces there.
//!
//! Faces are found through a bounding-volume hierarchy of their boxes, so a ray costs about
//! the logarithm of the face count plus the faces it actually passes near.
