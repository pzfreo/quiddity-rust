# AP242 PMI oracles

The fixtures the AP242 reader and writer (`docs/step-ap242.md`) are tested against, in the
design's order of authority: NIST's expected PMI (`nist/`), then OpenCascade's reading
(`occt/`) and draftwright's (`draftwright/`) as cross-checks, and specify-core's output
(`specify/`) as reader inputs only. Every capture records what its source says, as it says it;
none of them interprets or corrects.

| Directory | What | Made by |
|---|---|---|
| `nist/*.stp.gz` | 7 NIST MBE PMI test models (AP242 semantic PMI) | copied, gzipped (`mtime=0`) |
| `nist/<model>.expected.json` | NIST's expected PMI for each of them | `tools/nist_expected.py` |
| `occt/<file>.json.gz` | OpenCascade XCAF's reading of every NIST AP242 file and every `specify/` file | `tools/capture_pmi_occt.py` |
| `draftwright/<file>.json.gz` | draftwright's extraction of every `nist/` and `specify/` file | `tools/capture_pmi_draftwright.py` |
| `specify/<case>.*` | specify-core's output on corpus parts, with intent and answers | `tools/make_specify_inputs.py` |

## NIST models (`nist/`)

From `NIST-PMI-STEP-Files.zip` (NIST's MBE PMI test models; sha256 of the copy used
`1fb91bb8ff0fe02032b948fda0775bc74591cd0bebc0988347d32574e5884f90`), files dated as in its
February 2026 update. NIST says these are not error-free reference files.

| File | Edition (`FILE_SCHEMA`) | Units: drawing / STEP | Why it is here |
|---|---|---|---|
| `nist_ctc_01_asme1_ap242-e1.stp` | e1 `{… 442 1 1 4}` | none stated in the drawing text / mm | small; ±, limits, angle; datums B and C on half-cylinder pairs |
| `nist_ctc_02_asme1_ap242-e2.stp` | e2 `{… 442 3 1 4}` | none stated / mm | many tolerances and datums, datum targets |
| `nist_ftc_07_asme1_ap242-e2.stp` | e2 | `UNITS: INCHES` / inch | inch units |
| `nist_ftc_10_asme1_ap242-e2.stp` | e2 | `UNITS: MILLIMETERS` / mm | `LIMITS_AND_FITS('G6','hole','','')` ×3: not conforming (form variance holds the grade) |
| `nist_stc_10_asme1_ap242-e2.stp` | e2 | no drawing / mm | `LIMITS_AND_FITS('G','','6','')` ×3: conforming |
| `nist_stc_06_asme1_ap242-e3.stp` | e3 `{… 442 4 1 4}` | no drawing / geometry context mm, PMI measures inch | edition 3; mixed units |
| `nist_stc_09_asme1_ap242-e4.stp` | e4 `{… 442 7 1 4}` | no drawing / inch | edition 4 |

Total 3.2 MB gzipped. The STC models (based on the FTC models with less complex PMI) have no
drawing in the release.

### Expected PMI (`nist/<model>.expected.json`)

Obtained, not transcribed. The STEP File Analyzer and Viewer checks a NIST model's semantic PMI
against NIST's expected PMI (`sfa-nist.tcl`, `nistReadExpectedPMI`: columns A, the entity type,
and B, the PMI as SFA prints it, of the first sheet of `SFA-PMI-<model>.xlsx`, and the coverage
table `SFA-PMI-NIST-coverage.csv`). Both ship in `SFA-NIST-files.zip`, which is a member of the
freewrap archive inside `STEP-File-Analyzer.exe`, stored as one zlib stream:

| | sha256 |
|---|---|
| `SFA-5.51.zip` (usnistgov/SFA release) | `d7d06e2454c8cc9d6a41049b25d38eeb7822226660861af41e62613238d1a13c` |
| `STEP-File-Analyzer.exe` in it | `5bfa13823d5c104b2229c3d5dff4fd47f9f30cb17f1e9bbea78b749dc5104ba6` |
| `SFA-NIST-files.zip` (zlib stream at offset 4492140) | `5701884ac696f87bd5342d2bf099c15b01802b55d54829d0b355bc464175d1a1` |

Each `expected.json` holds every spreadsheet row verbatim (all columns, as SFA has them: e.g.
`⌀3.50 G6`, `⌖ | ⌀0.8 Ⓟ 3.2 | D | E | B`, `27.5 ± 1`, with SFA's own line breaks), the model's
coverage column verbatim, each spreadsheet's sha256, and `units`: the drawing's unit note
(`pdftotext` of `PDF/<model>_*.pdf`, null where the drawing text states none or there is no
drawing), the length units the STEP file's `GLOBAL_UNIT_ASSIGNED_CONTEXT`s name, and a count, by
unit, of the length units that `MEASURE_WITH_UNIT(value, #unit)` occurrences in the text
reference (a textual count, context for the reader, not a semantic reading). How SFA compares
(it normalises zeros and matches strings) is SFA's; the strings here are the data before that.

Because the expected PMI is NIST's own data, no transcription from the drawings was made and no
second transcription pass applies; there are no transcription errors to record. Where a reader
result differs from a row, the difference is to be resolved against the row, the drawing (CTC
and FTC models) and the file text, and recorded with its verdict.

## OpenCascade (`occt/`)

`tools/capture_pmi_occt.py`, specify-core's venv (OCP 7.9.3.1), `STEPCAFControl_Reader` with
GD&T, names and colours on, as specify-core's `load.py`. Per distinct part (specify-core's
numbering: `TopExp::MapShapes` face order on each part's own shape): dimensions, geometric
tolerances (with the datums XCAF links to each, their positions and modifiers), datums (with
datum target parameters and the tolerances that cite them) and materials, every value as
returned, and the faces each item references as `{part, face, advanced_face: "#N"}`. Items whose
faces are on no part are under `unattached`. Captured: every `*_ap242-*.stp` of the NIST release
(17, not only the 7 committed models) and every `specify/` file.

- `#N`: `TransferReader::EntityFromShapeResult` gives the entity; OpenCascade numbers entities
  by rank (file order), so the rank indexes the file's instances in order. The tool checks the
  instance count and that each face's instance is an `ADVANCED_FACE`, and stops otherwise.
- Class of tolerance (ISO 286): the OCP binding of `GetClassOfTolerance` cannot return its output
  arguments, so `class` comes from the object's `DumpJson` (`IsHole`, `FormVariance`, `Grade`).
- `known_misreads` in every capture lists what OpenCascade is known to misread
  (specify-core `writer.py`, `existing.py`). Values are not corrected: e.g. `spool_fits` reads
  Ø130 g6 as `value 65.0195, range, lower_bound 130.0, upper_bound 0.039`, and NIST magnitudes
  held in complex entities read as 0. Each difference from the haecceity reader gets a verdict.

## draftwright (`draftwright/`)

`tools/capture_pmi_draftwright.py` in draftwright's own environment (a detached worktree of its
`origin/main`, `uv sync --frozen`). Per file: `extract_pmi_report` (the `pmi='annotate'` path,
no part frame) — every census source with its outcome and reason, every record without the
fields that hold coordinates (listed in the tool), material facts — and each `_pmi_part21`
reader's facts as returned (geometric tolerances, datum occurrences and definitions, dimension
associations, display facts, length factor, material, manufacturing requirements prose and
structured, surface labels, common labels). A reader that raises is recorded with its exception.
`draftwright` in each capture is the commit (`4dfc63f0693bffa0e0e2836d254f53e15cce6f9f`).

## specify-core inputs (`specify/`)

**These are reader inputs only. They show how specify-core writes PMI through OpenCascade
(XCAF plus text it appends or transplants); they are not a reference for correct AP242.** They
carry the defects the design lists as anti-requirements (fits written as limits, OpenCascade's
complex and untyped forms where specify-core did not rewrite them, …).

`tools/make_specify_inputs.py` runs specify-core's CLI (`analyse`, then `write
--accept-defaults --intent`) with fixed answers. Per case: `<case>.step.gz` (the output),
`<case>.intent.json`, `<case>.answers.json`, `<case>.meta.json` (input and its sha256,
specify-core commit `cc341dd…`, specify-core's write report: what it wrote).

| Case | Input | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| `spool_fits` | corpus `cadgenbench/flanged_spool_132.step` | Ø62 H7 bore (datum B), Ø10 H11 clearance bolt circle with position 0.2 Ⓜ, Ø130 g6 and Ø70 f7 (both deviations below nominal), circular runout, flatness of A, perpendicularity of B, material, ISO 2768-m |
| `thumbwheel_thread_knurl` | corpus `gramel/GRM-03_thumbwheel_drive_screw.step` | tapped M2 hole with position, external M5 thread, diamond knurl, Ø10 f7 with runout |
| `bolt_thread_knurl` | corpus `gramel/GRM-05_depth_lock_bolt.step` | external M10 thread, straight knurl, Ø6 h6 with runout |
| `string_post_tapped` | corpus `gramel/string_post.step` | tapped M2 holes, clearance hole with position Ⓜ, basic location dimensions, flatness |
| `bracket_positions` | corpus `cadgenbench_inputs/cgb207.step` | datums A, B, C; flatness, two perpendicularities; two hole sets positioned Ø Ⓜ to the frame with basic location dimensions |
| `nist_ctc_01_merge` | NIST `nist_ctc_01_asme1_ap242-e1.stp` | specify-core adding to a part that already has PMI (its text transplant, `merge.py`) |
| `assembly_plate_pin` | two-part assembly (below) | both parts written at once, datum A on each part, tapped holes, clearance grid with position Ⓜ, basic locations, g6 with runout |

The assembly is the faces stream's `tests/fixtures/ap242/assembly/assembly.step` (a plate and a
pin placed twice; sha256 `ca5711668102f0e8bb9920469a46008e8a51d60e0bea7eb89a03089b0e464291`),
which was not yet committed when these inputs were made: a copy was used (`ASSEMBLY=`). If the
committed file differs, regenerate this case.

## Material practice

The PMI practice (lines 498 and 666 of `rec_pracs_pmi_v41.txt`) defers material to the CAx-IF
*Recommended Practices for Material Identification and Density*. Obtained:

- Release 2.1, July 12, 2005 (J. Boy, PROSTEP; P. Rosche, ATI/PDES), 17 pages,
  `RecPrac_MaterialDensity_v21.pdf`, sha256
  `11c81d9365236a835a70b9e0d223316d99a2da87b85a0b5dbbeff89d72e88448`, stored in the session
  scratch directory `ap242-caxif/` with its `pdftotext` text.
- Routes: a web search found `https://www.mbx-if.org/documents/RecPrac_MaterialDensity_v21.pdf`
  (404 now; `www.cax-if.org/documents/…` 403, `www.cax-if.de/documents/…` 404). The Wayback CDX
  for that path lists captures from 2010 to 2024 on cax-if.org and mbx-if.org, all with one
  digest (SHA-1 base32 `BMZQGVRRIIEEOHBOY7NBNTDYPMZX5E7T`); the copy fetched from
  `web.archive.org/web/20240419135511id_/https://www.mbx-if.org/documents/RecPrac_MaterialDensity_v21.pdf`
  has that SHA-1. (An earlier CDX search, by the mbx-if.org index, had found nothing.)
- Sections: §4 "Material and Density as General Property" (the approach the CAx-IF agreed for
  basic exchange): §4.1 material name and id — `property_definition('material property',
  'material name', <product_definition>)`, `representation('material name', …)` holding a
  `descriptive_representation_item(<material id>, <material name>)` (example
  `('AMS4928','Titanium 6-4')`), joined by `property_definition_representation`; optionally on a
  `shape_aspect` for a sub-shape; §4.2 density — `property_definition('material property',
  'density', …)`, `representation('density', …)` holding `measure_representation_item('density
  measure', POSITIVE_RATIO_MEASURE(v), <derived unit>)`. §5 "Detailed Material Identification"
  (material as a product, `make_from_usage_option`; density as general or material property),
  §6 Part 21 examples for AP214 and AP203. The document predates AP242; it names AP214 and AP203
  only.

Order matters: the OpenCascade and draftwright captures read `specify/` and `nist/`.

Verified on 2026-10-08: rerunning each tool reproduces its fixtures byte for byte, except the
STEP header `FILE_NAME` time stamp of the `specify/` outputs, which OpenCascade sets when it
writes (`make_specify_inputs.py --check` masks exactly that field and found no other
difference).
