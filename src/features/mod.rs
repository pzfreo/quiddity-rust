//! The feature recognisers, ported family by family from the Python implementation, and the
//! per-run machinery they share.
//!
//! Each family module exposes a public `recognise_*` (records only, the Python public
//! entry point) and a `discover` that takes the run's [`Context`] and returns
//! [`Occurrence`]s carrying the faces that define each record. Shared analysis — the cylinder
//! inventory, the point classifier, the part's box — lives in the context so a run computes it
//! once however many families ask.
