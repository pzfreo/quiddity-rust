//! Correspondence between two revisions of a part, from their recognition results alone
//! (`docs/correspondence.md`): revision-stable [`fingerprint`]s, and [`correspond`], a pure
//! function of two sets of them.
//!
//! 1. **Align** ([`align`]): a rigid motion from anchors distinctive in both revisions, or the
//!    identity, marked unaligned.
//! 2. **Match the features**: per family, a cost matrix of semantics, neighbourhood and placement,
//!    solved one to one with an "unmatched" option ([`assign`]); each old feature is then carried,
//!    adapted, ambiguous or orphaned, and unmatched new ones are new.
//! 3. **Match the faces**: seeded from coincident faces and matched features' faces, then
//!    propagated over the attributed adjacency graph.
//!
//! Every threshold is in [`Thresholds`], with how it was chosen.

///
/// - The *tolerances* (`same_rel`, `position_tol`, `angle_tol`) only have to absorb round-off:
///   a corpus part read moved and turned gives analytic fingerprints equal to ~1e-9 relative,
///   and so do a build123d revision's unchanged faces. The exception is a kernel defect, not
///   round-off: a sphere face whose boundary runs through the sphere's pole (cgb202's corner
///   patches) gets an area from the kernel that changes several-fold with the placement, listed
///   in `known_correspondence.json`; no tolerance would absorb it. They sit three or four orders above that
///   and well below any design change (a micron on a 100 mm part). `freeform_rel` is looser
///   because the kernel's B-spline quadrature moves with the placement (up to 2e-4 on most
///   faces, more on a few listed in `known_correspondence.json`).
/// - `anchor_candidates`, `anchor_pairs` and `hypotheses` bound the work. Four candidates keep
///   the faces of two-fold and four-fold symmetric parts as anchors; RANSAC needs only one clean
///   hypothesis among them.
/// - `min_inliers` and `min_inlier_fraction`: at least three anchors, and half of those with a
///   candidate, must agree. The aligned revision pairs keep at least 70% of their 8 to 15 anchors; the thickened
///   plate (every face but one changed) keeps none and is unaligned, as it should be.
/// - `cutoff` and `margin`, on the revision pairs: matched features cost 0.06 to 0.5 (a moved
///   hole 0.24, a grown pattern 0.5), so the cut-off of 1 leaves room above the worst. Unaligned,
///   swapping two identical holes 20 mm apart on the 100 mm plate costs about 0.064 and 5 to
///   10 mm apart 0.016 to 0.032: the margin of 0.05 separates the two, so a far repeat is still
